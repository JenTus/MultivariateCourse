## Q1

Create an R-function that takes a data matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times p}, n> p$, as an
argument and returns the unbiased estimator of the covariance matrix. Do
not use the built-in functions cov(), cor() or any additional R-packages.

## Code of Q1


```{r cars}
D1 <- as.matrix(read.table("data\Data1.txt", sep = "\t", header = F))

covariance <- function(x){
  ave <- apply(x, 2, mean)
  cent <- sweep(x, 2, ave, "-")
  cova <- t(cent) %*% cent / (dim(x)[1]-1)
  return(cova)
}

D1.cov <- covariance(D1)
cov(D1)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
